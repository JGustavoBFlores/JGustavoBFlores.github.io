This is a project aimed on teaching FORTRAN to anyone.

The main idea is that, besides explaining the basic grounds of FORTRAN, the student will not only write code but do changes to it or experimenting, by doing so, understand how FORTRAN works will bbe easier.

This course is organized in four main parts:
<ul>
  <li>Basics: How to start your first FORTRAN code, variables, math operations hierarchy.</li> 
  <li>Do's, If's and What Else: Loops, conditionals, and logical variables.</li> 
  <li>Files, Reading, Writing, and Formats: Opening, reading and writing files, and how to format outputs.</li> 
  <li>Global Project: A final code in which the student will write a code that can use all that has been learned, it could be sorting items in a list, find all the combinations of a set of characters, we will see! </li> 
</ul>

This is not an advanced course, it might not even be a course but a guide for anyone to learn how to write and read FORTRAN codes.
