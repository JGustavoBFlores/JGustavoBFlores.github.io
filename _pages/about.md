I am a mexican physicist, outerested in developing new computational tools for multidisciplinary research. 

I earned a bachelors degree in physics from the University of Sonora in 2020, as well as a Master of Science in physics from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2023. I joined Northeastern University on September 2023 as a Physics PhD student.

During my masters, I was a member of the Molecular Magnetism and Quantum Thoery Lab, and worked building new features for NRLMOL (Naval Research Laboratory Molecular Library), a Density Functional Theory code, under the advisory of <a href='https://expertise.utep.edu/profiles/mrpederson'> Dr. Mark Pederson</a> and <a href='https://www.cmich.edu/people/KOBLAR-ALAN-JACKSON'>Dr Alan Jackson</a>.
