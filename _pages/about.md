I am a mexican physicist, interested in developing new computational tools for physics research. 

I worked for two years building new features for NRLMOL (Naval Research Laboratory Molecular Library), a DFT code, under the advisory of <a href='https://expertise.utep.edu/profiles/mrpederson'> Dr. Mark Pederson</a>.

I earned a bachelors degree in physics from the University of Sonora in 2020, as well as a Master of Science in physics from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2023. I will join Northeastern University physics PhD program on the fall of 2023.
