  abstract={Noble gases are of great importance in the development of new theoretical tools before studying more complex and interesting systems, such as molecules and clusters, because their properties are well established experimentally. Noble gas atoms are also small enough so when testing a new theory, basis set dependencies can be ruled out. Here we describe a method for approaching configuration interaction accuracy by analyzing past results obtained by density functional theory. We present core level excitations for Neon and other systems.},

  title= {{Quantum Now: Minimalist Methods for Quantum Calculations and Experiential Learning}},
  author = {Lasode, Peter and Bravo, Gustavo and Rivera, Ruben and Woodruff, Gary and Garcia, Christina and Glezakou, Ourania and Glezakou Alexandra and Pederson, Mark},
 abstract={As an addenda to the "physics first" paradigm for early-science education we describe a course-based computational learning protocol that allows high-school students, undergraduates, graduates, K-12 teachers and seasoned researchers to move from addition and multiplication to fixed-basis quantum calculation without exposure to calculus and with minimal trigonometry. This "quantum now" software seed is part of a UTEP-PNNL vision for availing affordable quantum methods and education for all ages everywhere and to expose students to quantum mechanics while they are still in High School.  We describe the use of our PRETRAIN code,  relying only upon addition, multiplication, conditional commands and iteration to invert and diagonalize matrices, and solve for the particle in a corrugated box,  harmonic oscillators and the hydrogen atom. For the latter we compare fixed-basis minimization to the simulated-annealing-based non-linear optimization of the energy.  The protocol is intended for all that want to see what's under the quantum hood and provide basic quantum knowledge to high-school students interested in quantum careers. Efforts to release in python and excel are described.},
