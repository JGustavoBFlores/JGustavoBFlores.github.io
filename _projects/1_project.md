I am developing a short low level FORTRAN course. Link to it [here](https://github.com/JGustavoBFlores/LearnFORTRAN).

This course is separated in 4 sections:
<ul>
   <li>Basics: From creating a FORTRAN file to doing basic arithmetics.</li> 
   <li>Do's, If's and what else: Writing loops using DO and WHILE, as well as how to use the IF statement.</li> 
   <li>Functions and Subroutines: How to use intrinsic functions and how to write your own functions and subroutines.</li> 
   <li>Formats, files and everything: How to use formats, write and read from files, and a final project that would use everything that has been learned.</li> 
</ul> 

The idea is that the person interested in learning will not only write code but experiment with it by doing several changes in order to see what happens and have a better understanding on how FORTRAN works. 

This is an introductory course, I am not aiming for the student to become a master of FORTRAN but instead, this will be a strong starting point for anyone interested in learning this beautiful language.
