I am a mexican physicist, interested in developing new computational tools for physical research. 
Currently working on building new features for NRLMOL (Naval Research Laboratory Molecular Library), a DFT code, under the advisory of <a href='https://expertise.utep.edu/profiles/mrpederson'> Dr. Mark Pederson</a>.

I earned a bachelors degree in physics from the University of Sonora in 2020. Joined the University of Texas at El Paso in 2021 to pursue a M.S. in physics as well. 

An updated copy of my CV is available <a href='https://jgustavobflores.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf'>here</a>.
